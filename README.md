# DSCI6007-FinalProject

## Forecasting Inflation: LSTM Neural Network Through an AWS Data Engineering Pipeline
## Final Project: Distributed &amp; Scalable Data Engineering - University of New Haven - S24

**Overview:**

- The purpose of this project is to create a data engineering pipeline that allows for seamless data ingestion, storage, processing, and consumption via model deployment. This project is comprised of three tasks. 

1. The initial task is to ingest the necessary data and store it in a suitable place to be accessed later, namely an AWS S3 bucket.
2. The second task involves processing and exploring the data accessed from cloud storage. This data exploration will result in the creation of a machine-learning model that utilizes the data as input to train it and assess its performance.
3. The third task deals with deploying the model to the cloud and creating an endpoint (~API) for the model. In addition, the model must be invoked from the cloud to be utilized with a new set of input data to simulate a user interaction with the model.

- These three tasks were completed in three separate AWS Sagemaker Notebook files and can be seen in the code directory of the repository.

**Project Report:**
